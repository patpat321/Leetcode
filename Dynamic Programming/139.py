"""
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false

                    d[i] = True
        return d[-1]
"""
The idea is the following:

d is an array that contains booleans

d[i] is True if there is a word in the dictionary that ends at ith index of s AND d is also True at the beginning of the word

Example:

s = "leetcode"

words = ["leet", "code"]

d[3] is True because there is "leet" in the dictionary that ends at 3rd index of "leetcode"

d[7] is True because there is "code" in the dictionary that ends at the 7th index of "leetcode" AND d[3] is True
